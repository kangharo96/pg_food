Closing the gap between consumer knowledge on the health and safety of restaurants. The focus was later shifted to those with sensitive stomachs as we later discussed the topic with Professor Alex Leitch. We wanted to provide extra data on the establishment to consumers so that our stakeholders, Prince George’s County residents, owners of establishments and those with sensitive stomachs so that they can eat out with more confidence with food quality.
	
We worked with the Food inspections API on Prince George’s County,  https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/Health/Food-Inspection/umjn-t2iz , and created a website utilizing maps and graphs to show inspection types and inspection records across PG county. We chose to create this site using HTML and CSS because our group was unfamiliar with react and felt more confident using JS. For our map we used leaflet. It was because leaflet is an easy to use open-source Javascript library to build our map.
	
Our final system allows for users to look at the recorded inspections history of an establishment. Users are able to view the results and dates of previous inspections to find what their statuses are. Being able to search for specific locations or restaurants and see what places fit. 
	
The system lets the user search specific establishments by the name and see all the previous records of recent and past inspections around P.G county. Not only it shows the inspection date but also it shows whether the establishment complied with the inspection or not.
	
Challenges we faced as we worked to create this site such as - we faced communication errors first and foremost. We struggled to find times we could meet. After overcoming these we worked and found difficulty extracting coordinates from the API to use in our leaflet map.

If we were to pursue this project further, we would take this same idea and applying it statewide. If it is a success, we hope to partner with a larger organization to take this project idea nationwide! Another idea we could pursue if we had more time is implementing an affordability scale to compare establishments. This will users to find healthy/safe restaurants that are also affordable.
