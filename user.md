PG County Food Safety Website Manual

Introduction
This website allows users to look up restaurants before visiting them, to check their level of cleanliness along with the recent inspections. This is a vital resource for residents who visit food establishments in the PG county area. If you are someone with a sensitive stomach who can not risk eating questionable food, you have come to the right place. 
Data for this website was made available by the Prince George’s County open data portal. The specific dataset we used is called “Food Inspection”. It features over 3000 food establishments and their comprehensive, monitoring, and complaint investigations.
The website has a user-friendly interface and an interactive tool that allows the user to find helpful information about an eatery geolocation-based. There is a quick and advanced search option along with a live map. 
This manual explains how to use the site in order to get the most out of our vast resources. For all further questions, please get in touch with the PG Food Safety team.

Homepage
Once you enter the website, you are greeted with a map of PG county with several blue ticks. This is the homepage of the website. Each of these blue ticks represents an establishment and when you click on one of them, their name appears. At the top right corner of the map, there is a search box where you can search for a specific restaurant. Then, blue ticks will appear which represents the different locations of that restaurant. If you scroll down past the map, there are blocks that display the address and inspection status for each restaurant.
(Quick Tip: Use the zoom in/out buttons on the left side rather than your mouse or mouse pad to adjust the zoom.)

Below the map, there is a collection of blocks that display the address and inspection status of restaurants. Above this section are next/previous buttons (buttons with arrows on them) which allow users to look for restaurants on different pages. When clicking one of these buttons, the blocks section and the map ticks will change depending on the restaurants featured on a certain page. 
(Quick Tip: In each block section, the name of the restaurant serves as a link to another page that displays more in-depth information about that restaurant. More details can be found on page 3 of this manual.)


Searching
There is a quick google search button to the upper corner right, where you can search your favorite eatery place and it will show you all the places around the P.G county area with a maximum radius of 30 miles. Below an example of all the Chipotle Establishments around P.G country. The search button filters out the keyword “Chipotle” and out of 3000 eatery establishments, it will only show the places the match your keyword.

In-Depth Look at Each Restaurant
Once a user clicks on the link mentioned on page 2, they are taken to a page that shows more information about each restaurant. Such as the name of the owner, category of restaurant, and dates and results of each inspection. In the bottom right corner, there is a next/previous button so users can switch pages of the inspections list. 
(Quick Tip: Instead of clicking on the next/previous buttons, click on the show entries dropdown button. This will present the whole list of inspections without having to switch pages.)
