      <button class="accordion">How do I use the Site?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>You can search for the establishments that you are interested in, and the map will point to that location where you can find more information about that establishment.
        </p>
      </div>
      <button class="accordion">How accurate is the data?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          We pulled the data from the PG county database that is constantly being updated, so we know from that the data we have on the website is up to date.

          The map on the front page is interactive, so you can load information on the previous or current status of a restaurants health inspection, as well as the stores address and its location on the map as well as what type of food establishment it is (like fast food, carry out or restaurant).

      <h3>Statistics Documentation </h3>
      <button class="accordion">What is the "Statistics" tab, and how do I use it?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          The statistics page is dedicated to provideing the user information visually regarding the stats of each establishments based on either a map showing which areas passed a test, the records of each establishment, or the amount of records for each type of inspections done.
        </p>
      </div>
      <button class="accordion">How to Use the "Statistics" tab</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          The Statistics page is interactive, and initially shows the user a bar graph of the establishments vs the amount of records that said establishment has had based on the data found in our API. In order to view more statistics that we created to show off our data, click on the arrows to toggle through the different visualizations.
        </p>
      </div>
      <button class="accordion">What is that blank spot on the Geographical graph in "Statistics"?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          We believe that the bald spot in these graph is due to the lack of testing going on in that area.
        </p>
      </div>
      <button class="accordion">What are these Stats telling me?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          There are graphs where the Y-axis is the "Number of Records" (which represents how many instances that each x-axis category showed up) vs either the establishments, the type of establishment or the years recorded. And the Georgraphical map shows the regions of Prince Georges county that was tested and the specific areas that failed a specific test.
